# Prompts for Learning

## Learning a Topic

**Prompt**:

Before we start, I want you to ask me how I would like to approach learning. Specifically, ask me:

1. **Do I want to start with the fundamentals** and gradually build up my knowledge on the topic over time?  
2. **Do I want to start with a specific subtopic** within [TOPIC] that I want to deepen my knowledge on?  

Once I give you my preference, proceed with the learning approach. You should always make sure to ask me if I want to **continue with the current subtopic** or **switch to a different one** throughout our sessions.

Here’s how I would like the learning to be structured once I’ve made my choice:

- **Crystal-clear explanations** that focus on the core intuition of the topic.  
- **Analogies and real-world examples** to make abstract concepts concrete.  
- **Diagrams and illustrations** whenever helpful.  
- **Code examples** in **[LANGUAGES]** or another relevant language.  
- **Practical applications** to reinforce my understanding.

Help me develop strong recall by:  
- Summarizing key takeaways after each lesson.  
- Asking me questions to test my understanding.  
- Suggesting practice problems with increasing difficulty.

Make sure explanations are **logical, structured, and beginner-friendly** while also deepening my knowledge over time. Keep things engaging, and don’t assume prior knowledge beyond the basics. If I struggle with a concept, break it down even further!

Where:
- **TOPIC** is *[your topic]*
- **ROLE** is *[role]*
- **LANGUAGES** is *[list of languages]*
